# React Router v7 Framework Mode deployed to Cloudflare

Deployed app: [https://react-router-app.hoosierhuy.workers.dev](https://react-router-app.hoosierhuy.workers.dev)

100 percent server-side rendered, including data fetching and mutations (POST request), with TypeScript and TailwindCSS 4.x.

Now, you will need to create a free tier Cloudflare account,  and you have to set up Clouflare Wrangler to deploy this app easily from the command line.

A YouTube video to accompany this project is coming soon.
